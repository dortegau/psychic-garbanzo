# GOI Little Task Manager

The application provides a basic "to-do list", allowing to add, remove, check as complete, and filter tasks.

## Setup

Download the repo, and run

```bash
npm install
```

to install the projects dependencies.

## Running the application

To run the application locally in dev mode, run

```bash
npm run dev
```

Optionally, to build the application for production, run instead

```bash
npm run build
```

## Caveats

I set a hard time limit of max 2 hours of development to dedicate to the exercise. Considering this, a number of sacrifices were made:

 * There's little to no interesting development in the final code. This is due to using Bulma/Buefy components, which are very nice, and already provide all the needed functionality.
 * No testing was included.
